  Exhibit copy: At the start of the 21st century, the term Anthropocene was 
  coined to describe a new geological epoch defined by humanity’s transformation of the 
  natural world. Scientists have long known that human beings have a complex relationship 
  to the world we inhabit. We survive and thrive thanks to the earth’s many resources, 
  but we also cause irreparable harm to the planet. This exhibit surveys over 100 years 
  of comics that depict the pleasures and dangers of human interaction with the environment. 
  Comics have captured it all—including fears about pollution, the celebration of nature 
  preserves, anger at the failures of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the 
  recognition of the ways environmental destruction and global warming disproportionately 
  affect people of color.

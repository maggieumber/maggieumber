  Join me this Friday 10/22 at <a href="https://tangiblebookschicago.com/" target="_blank">Tangible books</a>
  from 7-9pm! This is my book launch for <a href="/chrysanthemum-under-the-waves.html">Chrysanthemum Under the Waves</a>!
  For the first time ever, I'll read at a comics reading! I'll share process videos and an animation
  and talk briefly about the book's literary inspiration.
</p>
<p>
  Saturday 10/23 I'll be tabling at <a href="https://www.slicexpo.org/" target="_blank">SLICE (St. Louis Independent Comics Expo)</a>
  It's a free event at The Sheldon in St. Louis, MO from 10am-5pm. I'll have all my comics and zines, prints, cards and toys.

summaries:
  - A paint and paper documentary, observing great horned owls in their natural habitat.
  - Sound of Snow Falling is a graphic novel done in a poetic documentary mode. In this unique work, the reader becomes a voyeur of the natural world, following a great horned owl family through the dead of winter. Extensively researched and expressively painted, Sound of Snow Falling is a triumph of the comics form.

reviews:
  - Umber has captured a small reflection of the natural divine.<br />&mdash; <a href="http://comicsbulletin.com/tiny-pages-made-ashes-31717-heads-2dcloud/" target="_blank">Tiny Pages Made of Ashes</a>
  - Umber's thrillingly inventive approach to cartooning constitutes an act of real empathy with the earth, an attempt to embrace the alterity and sovereignty of the sentient life that surrounds us. <br />&mdash;<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/review-katherine-collinss-the-collected-neil-the-horse-eleanor-daviss-you-a-bike-a-road-and-maggie-umbers-sound-of-snow-falling/article35325881/" target="_blank">The Globe and Mail</a>

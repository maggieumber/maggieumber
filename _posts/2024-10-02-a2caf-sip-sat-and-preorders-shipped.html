  This Saturday, I'll be in the artist alley at A2CAF: Small + Indie Press. 
  My first time tabling in Michigan I think?! I'll have advanced copies of Chrysanthemum 
  Under the Waves, Rust Belt Review vol 6, Death Spark 2 and my usual assortment of graphic 
  novels, zines, prints, cards and toys.

  <a href="https://aadl.org/a2cafsip" target="_blank">Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival (A2CAF): Small + Indie Press</a>
  is a one-day venture into the world of small press comics publishing. This event offers attendees 
  the chance to meet comic artists and learn about the art of creating comics outside of a traditional 
  publisher. Due to the content of many independently published books, this event is intended for a 
  teen and adult audience. A2CAF: Small + Indie Press is created in partnership with Athenaeum Comic 
  Art. Our friends at Vault of Midnight will be at A2CAF Small + Indie Press selling books by all our 
  headliners for signings.

  Thank you to everyone who picked up their advanced debut copy of Chrysanthemum
  Under the Waves last weekend at Cartoon Crossroads Columbus. I am so grateful to you all and to 
  Jared Gardner and OSU Pop Culture Studies for having me as their special guest. We had a 
  conversation which will later be on the CXC youtube channel.

  This week I shipped out preorders for

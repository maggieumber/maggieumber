  Storyboarding & thumbnailing are just as important as the finished
  comic pages. The rawness in the drawing quality is maybe not something
  I'm known for, but definitely a part of who I am. I have a very full
  calendar of comic, zine & print shows coming up (plus one performance)
  & I'm so looking forward to hearing what you all think of this new
  work!

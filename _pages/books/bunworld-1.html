summaries:
  - 4 frends! lil Baker (a tiny baker), Piper (a pipe smoking snake), a hungry Bun, a snug <a href="http://watermelondriveway.com/store.html" target="_blank">Dog</a>! Together with their bad frends, they inhabit a comic world where they bake weird humor, speak bad spelling and dream yum treats.

Bun runs away to sleep land where he meets his new best friend, <a href="http://watermelondriveway.com/store.html" target="_blank">Dog</a>.

summaries:
  - Jonesy is a wordless, watercolor mini-comic based on a dream...or as some would say, a nightmare. Maggie and Mom go on a wild ride. A cat, a dancing tube man and a suburban van collide in this night-time misadventure.
blurbs:
  - Gorgeous, and both mysterious and a bit unnerving. I love it. <br />&mdash; <a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2023/05/07/comics-daze-71/" target="_blank">Lars Ingebrigtsen</a>
reviews:
  - Beautifully done and worth checking out for anybody who&#39;s in a remotely abstract frame of mind. <br />&mdash; <a href="https://opticalsloth.com/?p=27810" target="_blank">Optical Sloth</a>
events:
  - Debuted at ICE CREAM (Iowa City Expo for Comics and Real Eclectic Alternative Media), 2023

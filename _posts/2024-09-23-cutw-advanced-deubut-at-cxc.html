  September 29, 2024 1:00 pm 2:00 pm Columbus Metropolitan Library <br />
  Maggie Umber’s work has always pushed the boundaries of the comics form—often wordless, deploying 
  unconventional media, and challenging narrative expectations. Her magisterial Sound of Snow Falling 
  tells the seasons of two owls without words, but evoking a world of sound that we might finally 
  hear if we learned to listen. Her newest book, Chrysanthemum Under the Waves, is a meditation on 
  loss, mourning, and the new lives we exhume in the process. Join OSU comics scholar Jared Gardner 
  in conversation with Maggie as they discuss her career, her craft, and her most recent book, six 
  years in the making and premiering at CXC.

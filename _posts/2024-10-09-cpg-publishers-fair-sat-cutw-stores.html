    in Philadelphia, PA. Here's some words on my new graphic novel from Domino Books 
    and Comics Blogger who will be distroing this book:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Maggie Umber has one of the most distinctive and unique cartooning styles in comics, and she now 
  presents us with her most ambitious work yet, a (mostly) silent horror themed work. 
  <br />&mdash; <a href="https://dominobooks.org/chrysanthemum.html" target="_blank">Austin English, Domino Books</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Maggie Umber's brilliant new graphic novel Chrysanthemum Under The Waves. A raw, moving, at times 
  austere visual journey. Easily one of the Books of the Year. 
  <br />&mdash; Thomas Campbell, Comics Blogger
</blockquote>

<p>
  I'll also have a Chrysanthemum Under the Waves watercolor hanging in the Marathon Art Show at 
  Fantagraphics Bookstore & Gallery in Seattle, WA.

    >The Academic Hour</a
  >
  is a multidisciplinary, debut graphic novel. It comes from the mind's eye of
  forever-student-of-life, Keren Katz. The once failed air traffic controller,
  highly trained ballerina and lover of the meandering path of endless education
  has found her true calling in comics.

  Anyone who wishes that the comics medium can be more than panels, formal
  narrative, and speech bubbles will do well to pick up this book. I wandered
  with happy dizziness among Katz's choreographed colored pencil drawings,
  poetic descriptions of paper-cut-out maps, and an obscurely documented
  romance. I adored seeing her lightly drawn process lines peeking through her
  final art. I was a joyful witness to the elongation of her characters and her
  endlessly stretched and shrunken architecture.

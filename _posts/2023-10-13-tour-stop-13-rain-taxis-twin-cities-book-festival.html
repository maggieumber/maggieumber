  Sat 10am-5pm, I'll be tabling Rain Taxi's
  <a href="https://twincitiesbookfestival.com/" target="_blank">Twin Cities Book Festival</a>
  at the State Fair Grounds in St. Paul, MN. The 2023 debut books from
  my Mostly Midwest Tour will be there, alongside my back catalogue,
  prints, cards & toys. This is my lucky 13th show stop! See you there
  my friends :D

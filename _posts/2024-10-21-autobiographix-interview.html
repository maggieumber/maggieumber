  Last Wednesday, my interview on the substack 
  <a href="https://autobiographix.substack.com/p/an-interview-with-maggie-umber" target="_blank">Autobiographix</a> 
  went up. It begins with this introduction:
</p>
<blockquote>
  I (Nora) came across Maggie Umber’s work in the latest 
  <a href="https://www.seanknickerbocker.com/store/rust-belt-review-volume-five-e25yy" target="_blank">Rust Belt Review</a>. 
  As someone interested in the intersection of comics with other genres, I was immediately struck by 
  her work as something harnessing the rules of poetry, painting, and more in a comic. To find out 
  more about Umber’s origins and approach, check out her interview below, just in time to pre-order 
  her latest work, the graphic novel Chrysanthemum Under the Waves.

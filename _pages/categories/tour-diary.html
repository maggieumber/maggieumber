<h2>About the Tour Diary</h2>
<p>
  This is the tour-diary portion of the blog. Topics include book announcements,
  behind the scene printing peeks, and many, many, oh so many, tour and event
  diary entries. Why? Because Maggie loves touring, even though it messes with
  her body. For more in-depth coverage and to support Maggie's work, subscribe

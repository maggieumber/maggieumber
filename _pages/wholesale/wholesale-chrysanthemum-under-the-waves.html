summaries:
  - Chrysanthemum Under the Waves is a book of mourning from Sound of Snow Falling author, Maggie Umber.
  - In the nine comics collected here, Umber grieves for the loss of her former self &ndash; a wife, a co-founder of a successful publishing company, and a person with good health living in a pre-pandemic world. Over the course of nearly 300 pages, she says goodbye to all she held most dear. In Chrysanthemum Under the Waves, Umber uses the demon lover theme, first as a way to hold on to her past, and finally, as a way to let it go.

  - A haunting snapshot of a relationship that juxtaposes moody reality with a merging, melting otherness as the former begins to merge into the latter <br />&mdash; <a href="http://www.brokenfrontier.com/holcombe-galvan-muradov-umber-reklaw-now-5-fantagraphics/" target="_blank">Broken Frontier</a>

  - Challenging our idea of what is story in comics [...] maybe it's a more a process of visual association, visual themes, visual latent motifs <br />&mdash; <a href="https://youtu.be/bLw5ihxXccc?feature=shared" target="_blank">Comics Alternative</a>
blurbs:
  - Feel the loudness of splatter and smudge. It howls and simmers. It is a pleasure to feel these 
    images, you donâ€™t read them, you feel them. Gaze into the dark pool, the surface of a well of 
    subconscious, like a crystal ball, shadows of dream and memory cast onto the page with brooding 
    inkiness and deep texture. Multiple styles of drawing here but all of them simmering with emotion. 
    Magical feats of comics communication within these stories, beautiful tricks of mark making 
    expressing what cannot be said. <br />I really love this book, very much. 
    <br />&mdash; Lale Westvind, author of Grip published by Perfectly Acceptable Press

summaries:
  - Startled Maggie is an auto-bio serial focusing on a mischievous little spit-fire. Drawn in light pencil, this new series is pointed at the ephemeral qualities of memory and what makes early life such a funny and charming place.
blurbs:
  - This has the potential to be a downright fascinating series when all is said and done. <br /> &mdash; <a href="http://www.opticalsloth.com/?tag=startled-maggie" target="_blank">Optical Sloth</a>
reviews:
  - 'The way Umber draws her parents as having blank eyes behind their eyeglasses is almost as perfect as the way she draws herself: a crazy-haired curmudgeon with either a glint of mischief or a permanent scowl on her face. <br />&mdash; <a href="http://highlowcomics.blogspot.com/2013/02/catching-up-with-2d-cloud.html" target="_blank">Rob Clough</a>'
  - It&apos;s hard not to fall prey to the charm of this book. <br />&mdash; Justin Giampaoli, Poopsheet Foundation

summaries:
  - Collected here are the storyboards for Maggie's forthcoming graphic novel, <a href="chrysanthemum-under-the-waves">Chrysanthemum Under the Waves</a>. They were made from 2016-2021. All were drawn with marker, brush pen, fountain pen, and or ink on rough watercolor paper. The letters were hand printed on paper made by Dave Dugan.
blurbs:
  - Maggie’s compositions, drawings, and use of black and white are exceptional. Viewing this body of work inspires me to do better as an artist overall, and in the composing stages of laying out a book. I cannot wait to read the finished book! <br />&mdash; Ash H.G., cartoonist behind The Golden Thread Zine & forthcoming graphic novel East District
reviews:
  - These storyboards are full of brilliant sequences in which the handling of the physical medium is integral to the transformation of characters and events. I especially love the line drawings of the couple in "Intoxicated." <br />&mdash; Sibil Bink, cartoonist and gardener
  - 'Maggie Umber is one of my favorite artists. I’ve been a huge fan since taking in her groundbreaking graphic novel The Sound of Snow Falling — a magical capture of quiet, nocturnalness, and the wonder of nature. Maggie has been working on a forthcoming graphic novel — Chrysanthemum Under the Waves — for a good number of years, and I have been anxiously awaiting it. I was thrilled to get sneak peek through a zine she recently published: Chrysanthemum: The Storyboards. It’s a wonderful rough cut presentation of a work-in-progress. I get increasingly intrigued every time I learn more about the project. <br />&mdash; Jeffrey Yamaguchi, <a href="https://bookpublishing.substack.com/i/141066382/zine-alert-maggie-umbers-chrysanthemum-the-storyboards" target="_blank">Book Publishing Brick by Brick</a>'

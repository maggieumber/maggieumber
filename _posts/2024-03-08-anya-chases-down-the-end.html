    title: Anya Chases Down the End by Jeffrey Yamaguchi
---

<p>
  Jeffrey Yamaguchi, a zinester turned published author, has crafted 
  <a href="https://www.jeffreyyamaguchi.com/anya-chases-down-the-end" target="_blank">
  Anya Chases Down the End</a> in many forms. The YA novella began as a writing challenge. It morphed as it 
  was read aloud in a writing class, spent time as a published poem, only to be reignited 
  by a collaboration.
</p>
<p>What a wonder it is to notice the things that are invisible, to bring attention to the misplaced,
  the left behind, the misheard word. This novella cultivates the rediscovery of such places and 
  people. Anya, a grinder at a book publishing company, is one such hidden person.</p> 
  {% include blog-single.html %}
<p>Anya is at the end of her six weeks interning at a publishing 
  house in NYC. At one point she compares herself to a 'sentient being transporting messages and 
  documents from one person to another, nothing more, nothing less.' Her big boss, 
  Francine, has tasked her with picking up champagne for a toast. She is on the verge, in her
  mind at least, of becoming a little bit visible in her cubicle and in her own life. However, she is
  actually not a 21 years old college student, but an 18 year old high school graduate without a fake ID.
</p>
<p>Her vocabulary ('lark', 'fabulist', 'suckage', 'Hot Max') and the cascade of consequences 
  following her lack of planning give this literary coming-of-age story its teeth. It achieves its 
  bite with a momentum driven by self-referential slapstick, cosmic misadventure and a red plastic cup of
  office romance.
</p>
<p>Write what you know is the writer's adage, and Yamaguchi follows suit. Born in Illinois and 
  raised in California, in his twenties he relocated with his wife to New York. He ended up 
  running marketing and publicity teams of several of the big publishing companies. It's easy to
  imagine him young and hungry like Anya, poetic hopes dashed by the reality of his 
  day-to-day survival. What a taste of delicious revenge when this novella transforms working  
  for the man into a satisfying and savory snack, the grind itself a feast, no matter the 
  size of the portions.

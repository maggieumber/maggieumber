<p>
  Chrysanthemum: the Storyboards by Maggie Umber - 6 years of
  storyboards collected in 80 pages - is now available on
  <a href="/chrysanthemum-the-storyboards">maggieumber.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Maggie’s compositions, drawings, and use of black and white are
  exceptional. Viewing this body of work inspires me to do better as an
  artist overall, and in the composing stages of laying out a book. I
  cannot wait to read the finished book! <br />

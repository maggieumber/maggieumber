  - Feel the loudness of splatter and smudge. It howls and simmers. It is a pleasure to feel 
    these images, you donâ€™t read them, you feel them. Gaze into the dark pool, the surface of a 
    well of subconscious, like a crystal ball, shadows of dream and memory cast onto the page 
    with brooding inkiness and deep texture. Multiple styles of drawing here but all of them 
    simmering with emotion. Magical feats of comics communication within these stories, beautiful 
    tricks of mark making expressing what cannot be said. <br />I really love this book, very much.

  I'm excited to share my first self-published graphic novel with you! 6+ years in the making and 
  topping off at nearly 300 pages, 
  <a href="/chrysanthemum-under-the-waves.html">Chrysanthemum Under the Waves</a> is a collection
  of nine comics. It's a book of mourning, a book of letting go, a book of love and loss.

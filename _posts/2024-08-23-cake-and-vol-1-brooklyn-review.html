<p>
  <a href="/chrysanthemum-under-the-waves.html">Chrysanthemum Under the Waves</a> got its first review! 
  Thank you to artist, writer and critic Dmitry Samarov. He says:

  Somehow Umber manages to make the heaviness of the subject-matter bearable, even beautiful. 
  I don’t know whether there’s really light at the end of this tunnel but she provides just 
  enough illumination to see us through. By letting her images speak, she’s able to say what she 
  wants more eloquently than many books I’ve read.

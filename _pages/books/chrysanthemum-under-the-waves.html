summaries:
  - Chrysanthemum Under the Waves is a book of mourning from Sound of Snow Falling author, Maggie Umber.
  - In the nine comics collected here, Umber grieves for the loss of her former self &ndash; a wife, a co-founder of a successful publishing company, and a person with good health living in a pre-pandemic world. Over the course of nearly 300 pages, she says goodbye to all she held most dear. In Chrysanthemum Under the Waves, Umber uses the demon lover theme, first as a way to hold on to her past, and finally, as a way to let it go.

  - Challenging our idea of what is story in comics [...] maybe it's a more a process of visual association, visual themes, visual latent motifs <br />&mdash; <a href="https://youtu.be/bLw5ihxXccc?feature=shared" target="_blank">Comics Alternative</a>
  - Somehow Umber manages to make the heaviness of the subject-matter bearable, even beautiful. I don’t know whether there’s really light at the end of this tunnel but she provides just enough illumination to see us through. 
    By letting her images speak, she’s able to say what she wants more eloquently than many books I’ve read.<br />&mdash; <a href="https://vol1brooklyn.com/2024/08/13/review-chrysanthemum-under-the-waves/" target="_blank">Vol. 1 Brooklyn</a>
  - 'For someone as young as she appears to be (I met her as I had before at CAKE, the 2024 Chicago 
    Alt Comix expo), I would hesitate to suggest it might be her “life’s work” but I’ll propose that 
    it is that so far for two reasons; 1) this is a deeply personal project, dealing very much with 
    her “life’s work,” at least the work of her life, until now, and 2) it is her most ambitious work, 
    by far. I’ll call it art comics, too, to distinguish it from alt comix, as the painterly image is 
    central here. And it’s most often wordless, or privileging the image. The fact that it involved 
    linking so many separate pieces and many of them wordless, it could be challenging to many readers, 
    for sure. It was for me, but it pays off for the work I invested. I can’t wait to see it in paper 
    next month. It’s tremendous.

  - This is a collection of stories... but it’s amazingly unified in mood. Many of these seem to 
    reference old movies, or at least how people were dressed back then. They’re all narrative pieces, 
    but (mostly) wordless, and it’s a bit vague what the story actually is — which works wonderfully, 
    really. There’s like a despair emanating from these pages. Excellent work.

blurbs:
  - Feel the loudness of splatter and smudge. It howls and simmers. It is a pleasure to feel these 
    images, you don’t read them, you feel them. Gaze into the dark pool, the surface of a well of 
    subconscious, like a crystal ball, shadows of dream and memory cast onto the page with brooding 
    inkiness and deep texture. Multiple styles of drawing here but all of them simmering with emotion. 
    Magical feats of comics communication within these stories, beautiful tricks of mark making 
    expressing what cannot be said. <br />I really love this book, very much. 
    <br />&mdash; Lale Westvind, author of Grip published by Perfectly Acceptable Press
  - Maggie Umber has one of the most distinctive and unique cartooning styles in comics, and she now presents us with her most ambitious work yet, a (mostly) silent horror themed work. <br />&mdash; <a href="https://dominobooks.org/chrysanthemum.html" target="_blank">Austin English, Domino Books</a>

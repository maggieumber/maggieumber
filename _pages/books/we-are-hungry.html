  - baby spiders like tiny stars <br />&mdash; Anthony Tadlock
  - One of a slate of recent releases by Umber, each of which have wildly 
    different aims visually and narratively. She leaves color behind for this
    one. A stark comic composed of open landscape pages and blocked 
    printed letters and spiders. WE ARE HUNGRY (everything is in all caps 
    in here) is a short tale of matriphagy. This is where a mother's young 
    eat her body. A process natural to some spider species. All the 
    phrasing is urgent and clipped. With gems like, "OUR VENOM 
    COURSES THROUGH ITS BODY" stamped out in rigid black letters. 
    It's less anthropomorphism, and more a translation of the baby
    spiders' base desire for survival. The central image is a huge black
    spider and her brood&mdash; made with stamps. Some dark, others ligher
    and "off register" creating an echoing or skittering effect. There is an
    insatiable hunger for these growing offspring. The simple language
    and compositions make this read something like a demented board
    book. The the stark image of the tiny spiders overwhelming their 
    mother is anything but comforting. It's eerie, but also kind of 
    endearing. The ultimate maternal sacrifice. <br />
